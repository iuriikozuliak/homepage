Since that time I have worked hard for a huge variety of clients, from small design studios to international companies all over the world. </p> <p> After graduating with Bachelor Degree in 2010 worked as a freelance web developer for a whole year. Starting to work, especially in low-budget segment, on russian freelance market could be a true nightmare, but I got excellent communication and problem solving skills. I worked on different projects from Facebook applications to large web sites for companies. For a few months even was in top 3 best developers on #2 largest russian online workplace. </p> <p> Also I got some experience of backend programming . Maybe I’m not an expert on it, but can work with full technology stack, and can either move closer toward the back-end or to the user interface. </p> <p> In july 2012 I graduated at the Ternopil National University with Master’s Degree, moved to Poland and started an Front End Developer at Clearcode. And now I can speak on 4 different languages, well, maybe my polish is not perfect, but I’m working on it. </p> <p> I’m enjoing the process of turning great design into precise layouts, write the code necessary for pixel-perfect UI/UX and bridging the gap between designers and developers. </p> <p> If you are interested in working with me or want to find out more about my work, feel free to <a href=mailto:i.kozuliak@gmail.com>contact me</a> </p> </div> </article> </section> <script>
